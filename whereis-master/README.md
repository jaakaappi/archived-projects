# Where is
React + Flask app for finding tools and other stuff in a workshop.

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ARCHIVED!
I no longer have time to work on this, as the need for the tool has passed. This project taught me a lot about React and opened a view into what I don't know in the JS world.

## Running:
TODO

## Architecture
TODO but probably something like: \
Front end: nginx > flask > reactjs \
Back end: flask > mongodb
